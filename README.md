# Portfolio React App

Welcome to my personal portfolio.

This was created to display my past, current and potential future projects.

In this design I was trying to go for a simple, plain, as much b&w/gray scale as possible. Only the screenshots of my past work and the logos for the skills are in color.

The site is responsive and should be viewable on most mobile devices.

If you have any questions, or would perhaps like to work with me on any projects, feel free to reach out.

## Credits
[code for swipe navigation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70612769/how-do-i-recognize-swipe-events-in-react) Adapted this code found on StackOverflow by using "useNavigate" and "useLocation" to create an endless left or right navigation by swipe for mobile devices.
