  "Sight Word Learning App for K-8\n\nThis is an app my wife inspired. As a schoolteacher she finds it frustrating that there are a lot of good apps to help with spelling, however the ability of a teacher or parent to track the progress of a student and the ability for the teacher to adjust the difficulty according to the specific studentsâ€™ abilities seems to be missing. This app will attempt to bridge that gap and allow students to learn and teachers to track that learning",
  "Spelling Bee Prep App\n\nMy elementary age daughter recently came home and said she wants to win next years spelling bee. As a parent I do not always have the time to sit down and practice with her the way she may need it to reach her goal. So I thought I should be able to do something about this. My goal is to create an app that will allow my daughter to practice as the app (device) reads the words out loud using speech synthesis and allows her to spell the word back. An icebox goal would be that the app is able to listen to her spelling out the word and work as though it were a real spelling be. That is the stretch goal.",
  "Arduino Based weather station\n\nSeveral years ago I was part of a team that sent up a weather ballon to the stratoshpere, some of the technologhy we used from that is still laying around my garage so I thought: I should be able to build something with some of this, and thus the idea of a weather station running off of an arduino or Rasberry Pi came to mind. It is a side project I hope to realise in the next few months.",
