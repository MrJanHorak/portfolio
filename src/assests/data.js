  "Battleship2022\n\nA remake of the game Battleship using Vanilla JavaScript. One player places the boats; the second tries to guess where they are at. One twist in this version is that a spy gives away the location of one boat.",
  "Tic-Tac-Toe\n\nThe classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. This was written in vanilla JavaScript in my early days of learning. I have gone back and added a computer player to the game simply using a series of conditional statements to mimic my own thought process of how I play the game.",
  "ea$e\n\nA personal finance app to help track spending, set goals and save money. This is a decoupled MERN stack app borne out of a 3-day hackathon in a cross functional team. In less than 3  days I worked with 3 UX/UI designers and 3 other engineers to create this app. After the hackathon I worked hard to complete full functionality of the app, tweaking the backend data models and routes to better match the desired functionality of the frontend. I also implemented the logic for the dashboard giving the pie chart and progress bar full functionality.",

  "High Frequency Word Diagnosis Tool\n\nThis app will start as a simple one to help track student acquisition of the first 300 Fry sight words.  Teachers for students in grades K-3 will be able to use the app to track the skill acquisition of individual students and print learning lists per student or for a group of students.  Words themselves will be categorized in order of frequency of occurrence in written text, as well as by regularity of spelling and included spelling patterns, so that teachers can choose word lists for instruction based on those useful characteristics.  Flashcards or word lists for groups or individual students may be printed for teacher reference. Later versions of the app may include research-supported instruction and games that include responsive feedback and track student progress for the teacher.",
  "Spelling Bee Prep App\n\nThis passion project is the result of a conversation with my elementary age daughter who recently came home and said she wants to win her class's next yearâ€™s spelling bee. As a parent I do not always have the time to sit down and practice with her the way she may need it to reach her goal. So, I thought I should be able to do something about this. My goal is to create an app that will allow my daughter to practice as the app (device) reads the words out loud using speech synthesis and allows her to spell the word back.",
  "Arduino Based weather station\n\nSeveral years ago I was part of a team that sent up a weather balloon to the stratosphere, some of the technology we used from that is still laying around my garage so I thought: I should be able to build something with some of this, and thus the idea of a weather station running off an Arduino or Raspberry Pi came to mind. It is a side project I hope to realize in the next few months.",
